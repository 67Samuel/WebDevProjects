<h1>The Best Movies According to Samuel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Along With The Gods: The Two Worlds</h3>
<p>
  Isa introduced this to me - I like it because it is thought provoking, doesn't
  stay in my mind for very long, and very well done in terms of acting and
  cinematography.
</p>
<h3>Kimi no Na wa</h3>
<p>Beautiful animation. I cried.</p>
<h3>Pay It Forward</h3>
<p>
  Great movie with a good lesson and the innocence of a child, showing what the
  world can and should be.
